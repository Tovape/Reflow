Software Needed:
Blender 2.79b (For Export in JSON)
Blender 3.0 (For actual Models)
three.js-r69 Blender Exporter

Steps:
1- Creation of the model in Blender 3.0 and get textures

2- Export Model to Blender 2.79b using the Append or Open the .blend file if you can

If you only use a static color, just add it to the mesh and import to js, don't worry about size
If you use images make sure to bake it, use the baked image into the model and export right away

3- Add Item to DDBB and verify the textures, you will need to add the dimensions in the sql
since it's the most reliable solution to resize the object
